OpenPaas is contributing to a mail server of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/), which is called [James](http://james.apache.org/).

Unlike others OpenPaas technologies, this component is a Java-based project.

One of our main goal is to provide a cloud ready mail server. In order to achieve that, we are using technologies such as Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Docker and much more.

As OpenPaas is web-oriented, the legacy mail protocol (IMAP) does not fit our needs, so we are also implementing a HTTP mail protocol which is called [JMAP](http://jmap.io/).

You are welcome to have a look of what we are doing, and also share with us and the James community your idea about mailing in the new century.
